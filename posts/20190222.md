# How to integrate existing angular project to another one
This is a task I have met when I was working. We need to integrate our existing Angular application(let's say project A) into another developing Angular project(let's say project B).

The basic idea is encapsulate A as a module and publish it to npm so that B can install it by configure the package.json as a dependency library module.
## Set up poject A
### 1.Create Angular Elements
Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custome elements so that the Angular elements can be included into other web application that enable to reuse
```bash
npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements
```
### 2.Register Custom Elements
```bash
npm install @angular/elements
```
The @angular/elements package provides createCustomElement() API to convert together its dependencies to custom elements.   
The JavaScript function customElements.define() will register the custom element tag with the Browser.    
The ngDoBootstrap method will tell angular to use this module for bootstrapping.

in app.module.ts file:
```javascript
import { Injector }                     from '@angular/core';
import { createCustomElement }        from '@angular/elements';

export class DistributionReviewerModule {
    constructor (private injector: Injector) {
        const distributionReviewer = createCustomElement(AppComponent, { injector });
        customElements.define('dr-root', distributionReviewer);
    }
    ngDoBootstrap() {}
}
```
